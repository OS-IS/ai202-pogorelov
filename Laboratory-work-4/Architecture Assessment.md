Security  Practice  Overview
----------------------------

#### Governance

Software assurance entails many different activities and concerns. Without an  overall plan, you might be spending a lot of effort to build in security, while in  fact your efforts may be unaligned, disproportional or even counterproductive.  The goal of the Strategy and Metrics (SM) practice is to build an efficient and  effective plan for realizing your software security objectives within your  organization.

A  software  security  program,  that  selects  and  prioritizes  activities  of  the  rest  of  the model, serves as the foundation for your efforts. The practice works on  building  the  plan,  maintaining  and  disseminating  it.

At the same time, you want to keep track of your security posture and  program  improvements.  A  metrics-driven  approach  is  included  to  ensure  an  accurate  view  on  your  activities.  To  measure  is  to  know.

#### Benefit

Common  understanding  of  your  organization's  security  posture

#### Activity

Understand, based on application risk exposure, what threats exist or may  exist, as well as how tolerant executive leadership is of these risks. This  understanding is a key component of determining software security assurance  priorities. To ascertain these threats, interview business owners and  stakeholders and document drivers specific to industries where the  organization operates as well as drivers specific to the organization. Gathered  information includes worst-case scenarios that could impact the organization,  as well as opportunities where an optimized software development lifecycle  and more secure applications could provide a market-differentiator or create  additional  opportunities.

Gathered information provides a baseline for the organization to develop and  promote its application security program. Items in the program are prioritized  to address threats and opportunities most important to the organization. The  baseline is split into several risk factors and drivers linked directly to the  organization's priorities and used to help build a risk profile of each custom-  developed application by documenting how they can impact the organization if  they  are  compromised.

#### Benefit

Available  and  agreed  upon  roadmap  of  your  AppSec  program

#### Activity

Based on the magnitude of assets, threats, and risk tolerance, develop a  security strategic plan and budget to address business priorities around  application  security.  The  plan  covers  1  to  3  years  and  includes  milestones  consistent with the organization's business drivers and risks. It provides  tactical and strategic initiatives and follows a roadmap that makes its  alignment  with  business  priorities  and  needs  visible.

In the roadmap, you reach a balance between changes requiring financial  expenditures, changes of processes and procedures, and changes impacting  the organization's culture. This balance helps accomplish multiple milestones  concurrently and without overloading or exhausting available resources or  development teams. The milestones are frequent enough to help monitor  program  success  and  trigger  timely  roadmap  adjustments.

For the program to be successful, the application security team obtains buy-in  from the organization's stakeholders and application development teams. A  published plan is available to anyone who is required to support or participate  in  its  implementation.

#### Benefit

Basic  insights  into  your  AppSec  program's  effectiveness  and  efficiency

#### Activity

Define and document metrics to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of  the application security program. This way improvements are measurable and  you  can  use  them  to  secure  future  support  and  funding  for  the  program.

Considering  the  dynamic  nature  of  most  development  environments,  metrics  should  be  comprised  of  measurements  in  the  following  categories

- 'Effort'  metrics  measure  the  effort  spent  on  security.  For  example  training  hours, time spent performing code reviews, and number of applications  scanned  for  vulnerabilities.

- 'Result' metrics measure the results of security efforts. Examples include  number of outstanding patches with security defects and number of security  incidents  involving  application  vulnerabilities.

- 'Environment' metrics  measure the  environment  where  security  efforts  take  place. Examples include number of applications or lines of code as a measure  of  difficulty  or  complexity.

Stream  B  -  Measure  &  Improve
---------------------------------

#### Governance

![](file:///C:/Users/sanek/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image029.gif)Maturity  level  1

#### Activity  (continued)

Each  metric  by  itself  is  useful  for  a  specific  purpose,  but  a  combination  of  two  or  three  metrics  together  helps  explain  spikes  in  metrics  trends.  For  example,  a  spike  in  a  total  number  of  vulnerabilities  may  be  caused  by  the  organization  on-boarding several new applications that have not been previously exposed  to the implemented application security mechanisms. Alternatively, an  increase in the environment metrics without a corresponding increase in the  effort or result could be an indicator of a mature and efficient security  program.

While  identifying  metrics,  it's  always  recommended  to  stick  to  the  metrics  that  meet  several  criteria

- Consistently  Measured

- Inexpensive  to  gather

- Expressed  as  a  cardinal  number  or  a  percentage

- Expressed  as  a  unit  of  measure

#### Activity  (continued)

Document metrics and include descriptions of best and most efficient  methods for gathering data, as well as recommended methods for combining  individual measures into meaningful metrics. For example, a number of  applications and a total number of defects across all applications may not be  useful by themselves but, when combined as a number of outstanding high-  severity  defects  per  application,  they  provide  a  more  actionable  metric.

Transparency  on your AppSec  program's  performance

#### Activity

Once the organization has defined its application security metrics, collect  enough information to establish realistic goals. Test identified metrics to  ensure  you  can  gather  data  consistently  and  efficiently  over  a  short  period.  After the initial testing period, the organization should have enough  information to commit to goals and objectives expressed through Key  Performance  Indicators  (KPIs).

While several measurements are useful for monitoring the information  security program and its effectiveness, KPIs are comprised of the most  meaningful and effective metrics. Aim to remove volatility common in  application development environments from KPIs to reduce chances of  unfavorable numbers resulting from temporary or misleading individual  measurements. Base KPIs on metrics considered valuable not only to  Information Security  professionals  but  also to  individuals responsible  for  the  overall  success  of  the  application,  and  organization's  leadership.  View  KPIs  as  definitive indicators of the success of the whole program and consider them  actionable.

Continuous  improvement  of  your  program  according  to  results

#### Activity

Define guidelines for influencing the Application Security program based on  the KPIs and other application security metrics. These guidelines combine the  maturity of the application development process and procedures  with  different metrics to make the program more efficient. The following examples  show a relationship between measurements and ways of evolving and  improving  application  security

- Focus  on  maturity  of  the  development  lifecycle  makes  the  relative  cost  per  defect  lower  by  applying  security  proactively.

- Monitoring the balance  between  effort, result,  and environment metrics  improves the program's efficiency and justifies additional automation and  other  methods  for  improving  the  overall  application  security  baselines.

- Individual  Security  Practices  could  provide  indicators  of  success  or  failure  of  individual  application  security  initiatives.
